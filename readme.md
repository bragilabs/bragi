## Directory Structure
```

entities - For all entities generated by SeaORM cli
migrations - For all database migrations
scanner - Scans the filesystem for music files

```

## Naming Conventions
Bragi follows a similar naming convention to Jellyfin:
```
- Music
 - Artist
  - Album (Release Year)
   - Track number. Artist - Track Name
```

For example:
```
- Music
 - Metallica
  - Master of Puppets (1986)
   - 01. Metallica - Battery.flac
   - 02. Metallica - Master of Puppets.mp3
```
